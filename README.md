# AppUsage
Finds order based on App Usage

Currently it is quite hardcoded. I am working to make it more interactive.
For the time being, you can run the code using my data by running main in Octave terminal.
Data from the digital wellbeing app on the phone is used to find the most probable app to be used. More improvements coming soon.
